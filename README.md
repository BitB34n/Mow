# MauMau
A version of the Crazy Eights card game made with Python 3 and PyGame. Crazy Eights is a fun and simple card game that can be played with a standard 52 card deck.

## How to Play
Mow plays kinda like Crazy Eights. Each player gets 8 cards.

The goal of the game is to discard all the cards in your hand.

During a turn, the player can play a card face up that matches the suit or rank of the most recently played card.

If the player can't match the top card, they must draw a card from the deck. If the rank or suit of the drawn card matches the card or suit of the most recently played card, the player can automatically play that card.

#implement base rules - change wild from 8 to J, Hail Queens, Reverse on 2, Name Spades, A skip
